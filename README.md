# Algorithms-Visualizer

this mini-project was created to illustrate how some of the most famous sorting algorithms work.
using simple controls to generate a random array with a specified size, the visualizer will show step-by-step the algorithm's method of sorting the array, providing 
colored indecations of which elements are beeing processed and when an element is in it's right index.
